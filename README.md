# PRODIGY_SD_04
Created an automated Sudoku solver server in Python, develop a system where clients send unsolved Sudoku puzzles, the server solves them using an algorithm, and then returns the solved puzzles to clients. 


Below is a description of how a Sudoku Solver is Implemented:


The program is written in Python and solves Sudoku puzzles automatically.
It uses the backtracking algorithm, a suitable technique for exploring solutions.
Functions are defined to print the Sudoku grid, validate number placements, and solve the puzzle.
The solve_sudoku function systematically fills empty cells while adhering to Sudoku rules.
It recursively explores possibilities and backtracks when necessary.
Input is provided as an unsolved Sudoku grid, with '0' representing empty cells.
The program attempts to solve the puzzle and displays the completed Sudoku grid upon success.
